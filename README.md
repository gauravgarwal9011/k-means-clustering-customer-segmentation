# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📊 Project Overview

This project involves customer segmentation using the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm. The objective of this project is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior or other features into distinct clusters. These clusters can then be used for targeted marketing, product recommendations, and business strategies.

In this project, I applied the **K-Means** clustering algorithm to perform customer segmentation on a sample dataset, analyzing the customer’s **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary (RFM)** characteristics. The project explores the following steps:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and transformation
- Implementing K-Means clustering
- Visualizing clusters
- Evaluating the clustering performance

### 🚀 **Technologies Used:**

- **Python**: Core programming language for data science tasks
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing and handling arrays
- **Sci-kit Learn**: For implementing the K-Means algorithm and model evaluation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and analysis

### 🔥 **Key Concepts:**

- **K-Means Clustering**: A popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data points into K clusters based on their similarity.
- **RFM Analysis**: A statistical technique used to analyze customer behavior by evaluating their **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** value.
